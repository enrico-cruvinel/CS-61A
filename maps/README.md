* Google Maps’ visualization of Berkeley’s restaurants segmented into regions
using a Voronoi diagram
* Each region is shaded according to the ratings of the restaurants
* Used Yelp academic dataset and concepts of machine learning to determine
the best predictor of a restaurant and predict its evaluation when there was no
user evaluation
